Full Stack Machine Learning Engineer,NY,Roboflow,"$180,000 a year",,"Who We Are
Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.
At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 500,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety , digitizing floor plans , preserving coral reef populations , guiding drone flight , and much more .
Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.
We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.
What We're Looking For
We’re looking for people that can own a large set of problems and are motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” Over 80% of our current team is a former founder and they love working at Roboflow because they get to work autonomously and build solutions from the ground up (but you don't have to be a former founder to thrive at Roboflow!). Roboflow is still early stage and each department runs a startup within itself that defines a problem, works with our customers, builds ideal solutions, and adapts quickly to changes.
Hint: The best way to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to our open source projects.
What You'll Do
Roboflow is a platform for training and deploying computer vision models. Machine learning permeates all aspects of our product, from advanced image annotation tooling to the training pipelines we expose directly to users.
You will be embedded on our Self-Serve team, which is responsible for Product-Led Growth at Roboflow. To be successful we need to make computer vision as accessible as possible to all of our users.
You will play a key role in this growth by adding new model architectures to our training and workflow pipelines, powering user-facing features like Auto Label , and advising our team on ways we can help users make better models. In this role you will wear many hats. Expect to talk with customers, work on open source projects , and have a voice in product direction.
As you progress in your knowledge of Roboflow’s mission and tools, you will have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for and drive your own projects. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.
Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.
Within one week, you will…
Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.
Ship something substantial to an end user
Within one month, you will…
Onboard in person with your manager (you’ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)
Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)
Make at-least weekly user-facing ships to production
Add a new model to our training pipeline
Participate in your first customer onboarding call
Within six months, you will…
Attend your first all company onsite
Ramp up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product
Build architecture that simplifies the process of adding new models to our training and deployment pipelines
Lead the development of several ML-powered features
Start helping to shape the product roadmap & priorities
Who You Are
You are an ML tinkerer who wants to see your work used by millions of developers. You have built production ML systems (either as a technical startup co-founder or a core contributor) and have experience working directly with the end-users of your work.
Our tech stack:
- Backend : python, FastAPI, Docker, node, Docker, Elastic
- Machine Learning : PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT, TFjs
- AWS : EC2, ECR, ECS, Lambda, Cloud Watch, Batch, S3
- Google Cloud : Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, PubSub, GCE, GKE
- Frontend : Firebase, React, jQuery, HTML, CSS
You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. The above tools span code in our machine learning stack to date - your opinions on new technologies that we adapt for new tasks will be highly valued.
We anticipate the role being focused 40% on machine learning, 40% on backend & infrastructure, and 20% on customer-facing work (onboarding calls, support rotations).
Who You'll Be Working With
Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific highschool hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.

When You'll Work
Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.
What You'll Receive
To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every six months to ensure we stay in line with the market.
The target compensation for this role is $180,000 base.
In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:
$4000/yr Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work alongside other Roboflowers
$350/mo Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high-speed internet at home or a co-working space
Cover up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family
Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision
